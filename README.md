# CustomerChurnAnalysis
The Customer Churn Analysis is done using programming R. This analysis is done to identify which customer has the high possibly to churn and which customer would likely to stay with the bank. BankChurners.csv file is used for this data analysis.

In this project ANOVA is considered as a regression method. We are trying to identify the relationship between the customer_Age (Continuous variable) with income_category which is written as characters (categorical) instead of continuous variable. The p-value determines whether the null hypothesis H0 can be rejected or not.

Chi Square test is used to determine is there any relationship between the income category and the educational level. The p-value is also used to determine whether the null hypothesis is accepted or not.

For the classification modelling, decision trees and extreme gradient modelling are used for easier comparison between its accuracy.
